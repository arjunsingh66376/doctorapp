# Doctor Appointment App (Flutter)

A simple Flutter application that allows users to browse doctors, view details, select available time slots, and book appointments using local JSON data.
I had  spent 2–3 days end-to-end implementation including UI design, local data handling, and appointment booking flow  on this project.
